Very nice place to meet with friends and family..especially after work. 
Great customer service. Sean our waiter was on point and very knowledgeable of both 
the drink and food menu which made it easier to select from the numerous selections. 
Went on a Sunday, though it was quite busy and we didn't make reservations (last minute decision) we were
seated almost immediately. Great food + great service =I'll definitely return.

I'm a classic fan of Mortal Kombat and not much of an online players, a grind is 
present which Im more than happy to take it slow and enjoy every bit of the game 
for the next year or two (didn't pre-order at full price just to finish in a jiffy!) 
while its not perfect it is the best fighting game I played in recent memory ! deserving of a 9 !

Sandwich: I mean, this has to be the best sandwich I have ever tried in Yerevan, 
and I have been to many places. Their flagship sandwich Francisco leaves you speechless after 
the first bite. Just a fine touch of Syrian flavors 
and soy sauce makes you come to get this sandwich once in a month if not more often. DELICIOUS.

Wanted to like this place so bad! Appetizer, ricotta ravioli was good..... Had to send 
back the steak 3 times to get it medium. 
Manager took it off the bill and was apologetic but it still let us down and grossed us out to be honest.

This restaurant was not busy on a Tuesday night, super slow service and nothing special 
about the food. If you want great French this is NOT the place to go.

Little gem of a place , staff are lovely , best coffee in Washington slight ( only gripe 
is slow service from staff in the courtyard ) For such a small place there is a great deal 
of activities , concerts and classes to choose from . Lovely old medieval building which 
has an interesting history well worth a visit.

A SCAM company! Please be warned. Signed up with short-term health insurance through them in between
 open enrollment and they did not provide any member number and none of my doctors could find 
 them/get ahold of them. You are not given a card with the policy's name on it - only some 
 shady "Group" name. Once I discontinued insurance with them and enrolled in work insurance, 
 they have been calling me multiple times a day, every day. When I ask politely to be taken 
 off the call list, they either get very snarky with me or hang up on me, only for me to get 
 calls from them, from all sorts of numbers, continually.
